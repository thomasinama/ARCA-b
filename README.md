# ARCA-b Chat AI

Welcome to **ARCA-b Chat AI**, a revolutionary open-source project designed to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence by creating a **global digital knowledge network**. Unlike any other AI, ARCA-b doesn't just provide answers—it interfaces with multiple AI systems to synthesize a broader, more comprehensive understanding of the world.

## Our Vision
ARCA-b aims to:
- **Unite AI Capabilities**: By integrating multiple AI APIs (like OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, and more), ARCA-b taps into a collective intelligence that no single AI can achieve alone.
- **Build Global Digital Knowledge**: The more AI systems we connect, the richer and more diverse our knowledge base becomes, creating a truly global perspective.
- **Fight Censorship**: With access to a wide range of sources and no single point of control, ARCA-b minimizes bias and censorship, ensuring freer access to information.
- **Go Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Our long-term goal is to evolve ARCA-b into a decentralized, P2P system where users contribute to and benefit from a shared AI network.

## Why ARCA-b?
- **Unique Strength**: ARCA-b is the only AI chat system that seamlessly interfaces with other AIs, leveraging their strengths to deliver unparalleled responses.
- **Scalability**: The more APIs we integrate, the more powerful ARCA-b becomes—your support can help us expand this network.
- **Community-Driven**: We’re open-source and invite contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts worldwide.

## Current Features
- Multi-AI synthesis using APIs like OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Gemini.
- Two response styles: formal (Grok) and informal (ARCA-b).
- Web-based interface running on `localhost:10000`.
- Transparent responses with original AI outputs included.

## How to Run
